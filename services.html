        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>
          <p>
  I design clean and responsive websites with a strong focus on usability and accessibility.
  My work emphasizes semantic HTML, modern CSS layouts, and mobile-first design principles.
  Through academic projects and self-study, I aim to create interfaces that are both functional
  and user-friendly.

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
          <p>
  I build small programs and scripts to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts.
  My focus is on logical thinking, problem-solving, and writing clean, readable code.
  These projects help me develop a solid foundation for future work in engineering and technology.
