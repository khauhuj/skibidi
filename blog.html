      <p>
        The semiconductor industry is a cornerstone of modern technology and plays a critical
        role in shaping today’s digital society. From smartphones and computers to electric vehicles
        and advanced medical equipment, semiconductor devices are embedded in nearly every aspect
        of daily life. Choosing this field has therefore been a meaningful and deliberate step in my
        academic journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        My interest in semiconductor engineering began with a curiosity about how small electronic
        components can perform complex tasks. Learning about transistors, integrated circuits, and
        microprocessors helped me realize how powerful and precise modern engineering has become.
        The idea that billions of transistors can operate together on a single chip continues to
        motivate me to explore this discipline further.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am studying Semiconductor Engineering at Asia University’s Ho Chi Minh City
        campus. My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge
        and practical understanding. Through classes and independent study, I have been introduced
        to semiconductor fundamentals, electronic components, and basic system design. These
        experiences have strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to technical knowledge, my academic environment has emphasized the importance
        of communication and collaboration. Engineering is not only about individual ability, but
        also about working effectively in teams, sharing ideas, and presenting solutions clearly.
        Developing these soft skills has been an important part of my growth as a student.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking ahead, I plan to continue my studies in Taiwan to pursue more advanced coursework
        and gain exposure to international academic and industry environments. Taiwan is globally
        recognized for its leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and research, and studying
        there will allow me to learn from a highly developed ecosystem. I believe this experience
        will significantly enhance both my technical competence and professional perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am aware that becoming a semiconductor engineer requires sustained effort, discipline,
        and continuous learning. The field evolves rapidly, and engineers must constantly adapt to
        new technologies and methods. Despite these challenges, I remain motivated and committed
        to developing the skills and mindset necessary to contribute meaningfully to the
        semiconductor industry in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        This journey is still at an early stage, but it represents an important foundation for my
        long-term goals. Through focused study, practical experience, and international exposure,
        I aim to grow into a capable and responsible engineer who can contribute to technological
        innovation and society.
